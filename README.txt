Anime Stream Search will allow users to type in the name of an anime and find a legal stream to watch it.

Right now, it contains anime found on Crunchyroll, Hulu, and Netflix. Hulu and Funimation share a library so any results that return a show found on Hulu can most likely be found on Funimation (unless that show is exclusive to Hulu).

No real styling/CSS done yet. If the user uses the autocomplete feature, everything should work without a hitch. There are bugs, though, when the user does not use the autocomplete feature. For instance, searching “hool” would return “hool can be watched on Hulu!” since “hool” is part of “School” which is part of “High School DxD”. This is a simple fix, however, and the code was included merely for testing purposes.

The show libraries are up to date as of 10/9/2016.
